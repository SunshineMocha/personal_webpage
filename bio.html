            <h2 class="titoli">In depth, the school years.</h2>
            I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa">Genoa, Italy</a> on the 5th day of September 1993. <br>
            Growing up I started to get interested in the IT field, at the age of 7 when I saw one of the school computer machines
            I was already infatuated by the aura that piece of old tech emanated. <br>
            Not only that, but with a great family friend already working around the same area, <br>
            I managed to grasp some knowledge from him that eventually led me to chose an IT course as my study address during High School years in the <abbr title="State Industrial and Technical Institute.">ITIS</abbr> Majorana-Giorgi. <br>
            Although those specialization years didn't go very well for multiple reasons, I still managed to get a 70/100 grade on the final exams.

            <h2 class="titoli">In depth, recent days and what I'm doing now.</h2>
            After graduating in 2013, as I could't afford University, I started looking around for a job. <br>
            Through June 2014 to January 2015 I worked as a grocery shop employee, starting to build some relationship skills with the customers <br>
            and, at the same time, studying for getting attested as a pizza maker. <br>
            Unfortunately, after the end of the contract, they decided the help wasn't needed anymore, so I started looking around once again. <br>
            Through June 2015 to September 2015 I started working on another grocery shop for a short period of time but, once again, when the contract ended the help wasnt needed anymore. <br>
            What came next was <u>probably</u> the longest work experience I ever had so far, working as a fishmonger from October 2015 to June 2017 when I decided to quit because I wasn't satisfied. <br>
            After a while, I started helping my father with his work for a while, working in furnitures until a big grocery store chain called me for a job that lasted 11 months (ended Jun 2021) <br>
            The past year has been spent looking through job applications and, with the help of the Axia Group I managed to find a course to reintroduce me for good in the IT world. <br>
            This website is the result of the very first 2 lessons of the course, I do apologies for the lack of customisation but as today (March, 9th) we're still learning.
